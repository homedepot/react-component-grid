# Contributor Workflow

* If you'd like to **report a bug**, just fire up an [issue](https://github.com/homedepot/react-component-grid/issues), we'll get it marked *bug* and we can all take a look at it.
* If you'd like to **add a feature request**, just create an [issue](https://github.com/homedepot/react-component-grid/issues) and describe what you'd like the component to include as a feature. We'll then determine if it's a good add on to the core library and contact you to determine how we can dole out the work.
* If you'd like to **add code**, tell us the feature you'd like to add via an [issue](https://github.com/homedepot/react-component-grid/issues). We'll then discuss it via the issue item. Then just fork the repository, build the feature and submit a pull request. Once the test pass, we'll review and merge the pull request.

## Committing Code

## Opening a PR
Each pull request must include a title and description.

* ### Title<br />
Your PR title should include a short description of the functionality your PR introduces. PRs titles are also frequently prefixed with labels like `hotfix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `feature`, or `WIP (Work in Progress`.

* ### Description <br />
By default, the PR template will automatically prompt you to include a description; this is where you indicate the purpose of your PR. Are you adding a new feature? Briefly describe the new functionality and include any relevant links. Fixing a bug? Make sure that you include instructions on how to confirm that the error no longer occurs. Updating the UI? Your PR should include screenshots from before and after your changes.

## Getting Approvals

In order for your pull request to be merged, it must be approved by at least one project maintainer.
